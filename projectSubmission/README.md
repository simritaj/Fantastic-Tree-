NOTE:Please download the Untitled3 file  pickle since we import these 2 files in our main program.
As soon as we execute the program please follow these steps:
1. Choose the "Create" option to customize the parking slot. Click on the grey box on the extreme right side to create your roads on the grid. Double click on the blocks on the grid to shade it in that particular colour.Next click on the red button that says "full" and double click on the blocks on the grid that are full. Click on the green button that says " vacant" to double click on the grid slots that are vacant indicating the parking spots.
2. Remember not to choose any blocks on the extreme most right coloumn! Make your parking lot as filled as possible by visualizing a shopping malls parking lot.
Close the parking lot tkinter window and on input at the shell type in "Navigate". It will open up the customized parking lot, double click on the Locn black button to mark the user location ON ONE OF THE GREY ROAD BLOCKS ALONG THE EDGE.
Close the window and on your shell you can see that the program now informs you the CLOSEST VACANT PARKING SPOT and the path to go from your location to that spot. Now the spot is all yours!
Type anything other than "create" or "navigate" to break out of the loop and quit the program.
Hope you found our appliaction useful!!
